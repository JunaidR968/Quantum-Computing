Building Molecular Hamiltonians and Antaszts Circuits for LiH and H2 Molecule.
This repository contains the codes for Molecular Hamiltonians and Antaszts Circuits for LiH and H2 Molecule which were modelled as a part of the project taken up to Simulate ground state energy of the molecules using the VQE algorithm.
